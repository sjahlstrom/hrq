      "content": "Level 1) Creation of an RQ (Relationship Quotient) score, generated from HighRQ's questionnaire. \n\nAnswers will be scored and a written report will be sent only to you, which will include HighRQ's proprietary RQ evaluation and score, and a description of the qualities that contribute to HighRQ's score. All members have to participate in Level 1 and take the RQ questionnaire.\n\nIn the near future, there will be two additional levels of service(s)\n\nLevel 2) Creation of a CQ (Compatibility Quotient) score, generated from yours and a mutually agreed upon partner's answers to the HighRQ Questionnaire. This level of service is designed to measure compatibility between people already in a relationship, or between people who wish to compare their scores individually when they both at least know each other. When both parties agree to compare their RQ scores to each other, a written report will be sent separately to both of you, which will include the RQ scores for both. The CQ is derived from the pattern of scoring that generates each individual RQ score and the relationship(s) of the many scales between each partner. The CQ report will explain the key areas where you match, or not, and will yield a numeric score and explanation. Additional materials will be sent to increase compatibility, if desired. Level 2 service(s) are not offered at the present time and are optional.\n\nLevel 3) Creation of matching information for you and another on the dating service(s), based on your RQ and another's score on the HighRQ Questionnaire (plus additional demographic information provided by you and others for additional matching criteria). This level of service is designed to match people who do not know each other; in other words, to create a CQ for people who wish to meet others on a dating site. The written report may be requested, or the two recipients may only want their individual RQ's and self-select other participants on the dating site. If desired, the optional written report will describe expected compatibilities (CQ) and material can be available to boost the CQ. Level 3 service(s) are currently not available and are optional.\n\nThis Agreement will apply to all aspects of the service(s) described above. The following terms and their definitions will be used throughout this agreement."

      "title": "Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver",
      "content": "This arbitration agreement facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and HighRQ. Arbitration is a private dispute resolution forum in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, using a judge with or without a jury trial.\n\nAll disputes between you and HighRQ shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims to a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this arbitration agreement also constitutes a waiver of HighR's right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and usually an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this arbitration agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including attorney's fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law.\n\nFor the purpose of this arbitration agreement, \"HighRQ\" means HighRQ, Inc or HighRQ.com., it's parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents. The term \"Dispute\" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and HighRQ regarding any aspect of HighRQ's relationship with you, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). \"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.\n\nHighRQ and you each agree that, except as provided below, any and all disputes, as defined above, whether presently in existence or based on acts or omissions in the past or in the future, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration rather than in court in accordance with this arbitration agreement.\n\nFor all disputes you must first give HighRQ an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to admin@highrq.com. That written notification must include HighRQ's name, HighRQ's address, a written description of the dispute, and a description of the specific relief you seek. If HighRQ does not resolve the dispute to HighRQ's and your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives written notification, you may pursue HighRQ's dispute in arbitration.\n\nIf this arbitration agreement applies and the dispute is not resolved either you or HighRQ may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration agreement.\n\nBecause HighRQ's contract concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\n\nThe arbitrator may award, on an individual basis, any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n\nYou may initiate arbitration in your city or in the federal judicial district that includes HighRQ's address that you provide in HighRQ's written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. In the event that HighRQ initiates an arbitration, it may only do so in the federal judicial district that includes HighRQ's address that you provide in HighRQ's written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.\n\nThe parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and HighRQ specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other member of HighRQ and/or user of HighRQ service(s), can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding.\n\nYou will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are also responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses, travel, meals, copying documents, etc. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with HighRQ as provided in the section above titled \"Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution\" and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover from HighRQ actual and reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.\n\nIf any clause within this arbitration agreement, other than the class action waiver clause above, is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this arbitration agreement and the remainder of this arbitration agreement will be given full force and effect. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against HighRQ, except for small-claims court actions, may be commenced only in the federal or state court located in (to be arranged) County, (to be arranged). You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.\n\nThis arbitration agreement shall survive the termination of HighRQ's contract with you and your use of HighRQ's service(s)."
