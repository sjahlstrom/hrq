Sample report, based on several testQuestions in each of a sample of four areas.   This is one page of probably ten or fifteenâ€¦and assumes you randomly score higher on some scales, lower on others.

According to your scores, based upon a comparison to norms, the following are likely true:

When it comes to social awareness, you can  assess social situations with ease, gauging the "temperature and tone" of social gatherings.   This allows you to smoothly integrate with others, potentially to converse more with ease and blend with a group.   Individually, equally you will also be able to talk with just one person, but that may not be necessary if you happen to be an extravert.   Introverts have this same skill but prefer more individual interactions than with groups.

When it comes to motivation, you are in the middle, neither a self-starter, nor a laggard.   This will not be a problem if your partner is the same, but will cause conflicts if your partner is either very slow to engage, or is hyper in this area.   Your orientation is neutral, which gives you some flexibility.

Self-awareness works in your favor.   You know how you feel internally, and how you react to things external--situations, other people, your partner, specifically.   This is one of many signs of emotional intelligence--a necessary quality to support a healthy relationship.   This ability also will serve you at work and school, or in social or athletic interactions.

Your level of compassion needs a little work.   This trait is empathy's first cousin.   It serves to grease the skids of communication, which follows from caring for others.   Your level is slightly low, suggesting a need to read about this and related traits (forgiveness, agreeableness, etc.) to boost your RQ.   Fortunately, these traits can be learned.
